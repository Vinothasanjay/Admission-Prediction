# Admission Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of admission to a university based on historical applicant data using machine learning algorithms.

## Overview

The admission prediction model is built using Python and utilizes popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. It analyzes various factors such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university ratings, and letter of recommendation strengths to predict the probability of admission.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from [Dataset Name/Source]. It contains the following columns:

- **GRE Score**: Graduate Record Examination score (out of 340)
- **TOEFL Score**: Test of English as a Foreign Language score (out of 120)
- **University Rating**: Rating of the university applied to (out of 5)
- **SOP**: Statement of Purpose strength (out of 5)
- **LOR**: Letter of Recommendation strength (out of 5)
- **CGPA**: Cumulative Grade Point Average (out of 10)
- **Research**: Research experience (binary: 0 or 1)
- **Chance of Admit**: Probability of admission (target variable, ranging from 0 to 1)

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the notebook)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/admission-prediction.git
   cd admission-prediction
   ```

2. **Explore the dataset:**

   - Use Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment to open and explore the `admission_prediction.ipynb` notebook.
   - Review the data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering techniques used.

3. **Train the model:**

   - Run the notebook cells to preprocess the data, split it into training and testing sets, and train the machine learning model.
   - Various algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Gradient Boosting can be tested and evaluated.

4. **Evaluate and predict:**

   - Evaluate the trained model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.
   - Predict admission probabilities for new data or validate predictions against the test dataset.

5. **Experiment and improve:**

   - Experiment with different algorithms, hyperparameters, and feature selections to improve prediction accuracy.
   - Visualize results using Matplotlib or other visualization libraries to gain insights into model performance.
